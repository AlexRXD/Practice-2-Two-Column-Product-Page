# Sell Page Project

This project consists of a simple web page designed for selling a property. It includes an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`mystyle.css`).

## Files

- **index.html**: The main structure of the web page, containing:
  - A header with a navigation bar.
  - A main section showcasing a property with images and a description.
  - A button to proceed with the purchase.

- **mystyle.css**: The stylesheet defining the page's design, including:
  - A green background.
  - A structured layout with a responsive grid.
  - Styled elements such as buttons, text, and images.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Ensure that `mystyle.css` is correctly linked for proper styling.
3. Modify the content as needed to fit different products or properties.

## Dependencies

- Google Fonts (`Playwrite IN Guides`)
- External images from Wikimedia and Post & Porch

## Notes

- The layout uses flexbox and grid for alignment.
- The button style is currently large (300x300px), which might need resizing.
- The property description is sample text and should be replaced with real data.
